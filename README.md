# hubway-trip-history
Data analysis of Hubway's trip history.

The data-set can be downloaded from this page.

http://hubwaydatachallenge.org/trip-history-data/

This is a small data analysis pet project in R. I have provided a two markdown files which includes the analysis.

There are two markdown files in the repo:

1. hubway-data-github.md -> This is specifically uploaded for someone who wants to see the output right here. Github doesn't shows the output images for Rmd files.

2. hubway-data.Rmd -> This is uploaded for someone who wants to clone it and use it for their own purpose because it directly runs in RStudio.
